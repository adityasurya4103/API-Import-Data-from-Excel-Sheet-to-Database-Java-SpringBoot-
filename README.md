# ExcelSheet-Database API 

# imort from excelsheet to database and export from database to excel sheet
Overview
This project is an API designed to seamlessly fetch data from an Excel sheet and store it in a MySQL database. It comprises a robust backend implemented in Java Spring Boot and a dynamic frontend built with Angular. Additionally, the system incorporates JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication, ensuring that only authorized administrators can access and manage the data.

Features
Data Import from Excel: The API provides functionality to efficiently import data from Excel sheets, allowing users to easily update and manage information.

Backend in Java Spring Boot: Leveraging the power and flexibility of Java Spring Boot, the backend ensures a scalable and efficient foundation for handling data operations.

Frontend in Angular: The Angular frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API, enabling seamless data visualization and manipulation.

MySQL Database: The API integrates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve data, ensuring data persistence and reliability.

JWT Authentication: To enhance security, the API implements JSON Web Tokens for authenticating administrators, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
